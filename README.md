# OOP Phrase Hunter Game
 Python Techdegree Project 3

The game is console/terminal based

The player's goal is to guess all hidden letters in a random phrase

The game is similar to hangman in that there are underscores (_)

The underscores represent the missing letters for the phrase
The player inputs a guess for a letter in the phrase
If a player guesses a letter correctly, then they can no longer use that letter
The letter automatically replaces the underscore (_) positions where it is present throughout the phrase
The letter(s) stay visible until the phrase is entirely decoded
If the player guesses incorrectly, then they have used 1 of their 5 chances to win the game
If the player guesses incorrectly five times, then they lose the game
The player either guesses all the letters of the phrase correctly, and wins or
The player guess all the letters incorrectly, using all 5 of their attempts, and loses
